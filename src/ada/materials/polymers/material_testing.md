# Material Testing Specifications
The intention with this section is to demonstrate all test rigs in order to adequately describe a polymer material 
in a finite element analysis

An overview of the different test techniques are:

## Compressive Testing

### ASTM D695 - Compressive Properties of Rigid Plastics
A similar ISO standard is **ISO 604** according to [prospector](https://materials.ulprospector.com/en/propertyhelp/doc?pid=600)

    Test Speed:

    An example of the test setup is shown below   
![Compression Tool](../../figures/ASTM_D695_compression_tool.png)

    For thicker materials total length, **L=50.8mm**, while for materials 
    thinner than < 3.2mm, **L=79.4mm** which the figure below shows.
